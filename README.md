# es6-websocket-demo
basic ES6 implementation of websockets to learn how they work :)

This is a modernisation of the tutorial available at http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/an-introduction-to-websockets.
I added functionality to reconnect if the websocket disconnects.

To run it, clone the code and then open index.html in yuor browser.

Enjoy!
